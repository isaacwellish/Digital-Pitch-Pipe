# Digital-Pitch-Pipe
A pitch pipe made with the Circuit Playground Express!

This project uses Adafruit's Circuit Playground Express as a pitch pipe

Many vocalists and choirs use chromatic pitch pipes, which are essentially chromatic harmonicas, to find their starting pitch.

How it works:

Once code is uploaded to Circuit Playground, use the up and down buttons to move up and down pitches.

Once a pitch is selected, blow into the circuit playground and hear your pitch!

Each note corresponds to a different LED and LED colors represent flat, natural, and sharp notes as seen below:

*make sure to include libraries
