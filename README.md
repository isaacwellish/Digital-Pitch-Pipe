# Digital-Pitch-Pipe
A pitch pipe made with the Circuit Playground Express!

This project uses Adafruit's Circuit Playground Express as a pitch pipe

Many vocalists and choirs use chromatic pitch pipes, which are essentially chromatic harmonicas, to find their starting pitch.

How to use:

1. Make sure Circuit Playground is configured with CircuitPython -> (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/circuitpython-quickstart)

2. Upload code.py to Circuit Playground (also upload CircuitPlayground libraries found here: (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/circuitpython-libraries)

3. Use the up and down buttons to move up and down pitches.

4. Once a pitch is selected, blow into the circuit playground and hear your pitch!

Each note corresponds to a different LED and LED colors represent flat, natural, and sharp notes as seen below:
